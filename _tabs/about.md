# Hello, I'm Vishal Lakshmi Narayanan

I work at the intersection of data, engineering, and real-world decisions. Currently, I am a **Data Science graduate student at Arizona State University**, specializing in AI/ML systems that are built for production rather than just a sandbox.

## What I Focus On

Most of my work revolves around building systems that don’t just analyze data, but actually hold up in the real world—whether that’s scalable pipelines, risk-aware ML models, or tools that make messy information usable.

* **Production ML:** I’ve designed semantic search systems and built production-grade resume parsing pipelines.
* **Risk & Edge Cases:** I developed "Loss-at-Risk" optimization functions for insurance forecasting and built explainable credit risk models using Neural Additive Models (NAMs).
* **Data Engineering:** I’ve built serverless pipelines and worked on "Builder Intelligence" architectures for complex data analysis.

## Background & Experience

Before starting my graduate studies at **ASU**, I worked across analytics, research, and applied ML—from forecasting demand across nationwide retail outlets to evaluating healthcare architectures for low-resource settings. 

I am a former **Technical Officer at DevLabs** and currently serve as the **AI MakerSpace Project Manager** with The AI Society at ASU. I’ve also published academic research in journals like *Dovepress* from my time as a Research Intern.

## Why I Build

I like work that’s practical, slightly uncomfortable, and forces trade-offs. If a solution looks impressive but can’t be deployed, I’m probably not interested.
